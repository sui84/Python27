Introduction
============

txtorcon is an implementation of the `control-spec
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/control-spec.txt>`_
for `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/projects/projects.html.en>`_
using the `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`_ networking
library for `Python <http://python.org/>`_.

With txtorcon you can launch tor; connect to already-running tor
instances; use tor as a client (via SOCKS5); set up services over tor;
change all aspects of configuration; track live state (active circuits
and streams, etc); do DNS via Tor; and query other information from
the tor daemon.

txtorcon would be of interest to anyone wishing to write event-based
software in Python that uses the Tor network as a client or a service
(or just wants to display information about a locally running
tor). Twisted already provides many robust protocol implementations,
deployment, logging and integration with GTK, Qt and other graphics
frameworks -- so txtorcon can be used for command-line or GUI
applications or integrate with long-lived daemons easily.

In fact, due to support for endpoints (adding the ``tor:`` and
``onion:`` plugins), many Twisted applications can now integrate with
Tor with **no code changes**. For example, you can use the existing
Twisted webserver via ``twistd`` to serve your ``~/public_html``
directory over an onion service:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ sudo apt-get install python-txtorcon
   $ twistd web --port "onion:80" --path ~/public_html

txtorcon strives to provide sane and **safe** defaults. txtorcon is `a
Tor project <https://www.torproject.org/projects/projects.html.en>`_.

Features Overview
-----------------

Currently, txtorcon is capable of:

- making arbitrary client connections to other services over Tor;
- configuring `twisted.web.client.Agent <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/client.html>`_ instances to do Web requests over Tor;
- doing both of the above over specific circuits;
- listening as an Onion service;
- maintaining up-to-date (live) state information about Tor: Circuits, Streams and Routers (relays);
- maintaining current (live) configuration information;
- maintaining representation of Tor's address mappings (with expiry);
- interrogating initial state of all three of the above;
- listening for and altering stream -> circuit mappings;
- building custom circuits;
- Circuit and Stream state listeners;
- listening for any Tor EVENT;
- launching and/or controlling a Tor instance (including Tor Browser Bundle);
- complete Twisted endpoint support (both "onion"/server side and
  client-side). This means you may be able to use *existing* Twisted
  software via Tor with **no code changes**. It also is the preferred
  way to connect (or listen) in Twisted.

Comments (positive or negative) appreciated. Even better if they come
with patches ðŸ˜‰
